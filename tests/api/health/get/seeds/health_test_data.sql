-- Health endpoint test seed data
-- This file contains any test data needed for health endpoint tests
-- Currently no specific data is needed for health checks, but this demonstrates the pattern

-- Example: If we needed to ensure specific system state for health checks
-- INSERT INTO system_status (component, status, last_check) VALUES 
-- ('database', 'healthy', NOW()),
-- ('api', 'healthy', NOW());

-- For now, this file serves as a placeholder and pattern demonstration
-- Health endpoint tests rely on the basic database connection which is 
-- automatically available after migrations run
